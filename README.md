# JoyDB
JOY database is an enterprise ready decentralized application framework with military grade security.

# Concept
A collaborative effort to build the most amazing database for developers and non-developers. Sports an amazing proposed feature set like being modular, clustering and shared resource pooling. 
Made possible with [Frame](https://github.com/frame-js/Frame)

<br>

# Details:
JoyDB is a modular first database, this means users have the ability to roll their own database like Legos. The default `server.js` is for non-devs who want out of the box functionality, custom configuration, and potentially an IDE. Other modular parts include exposing the Query module to communication adapters (like HTTP server, Websockets, etc).

## Features:
- Modular (Build your own DB)
- Pre-built (Use our pre-built code with configuration) - `server.js`
- Exposed Query support for HTTP, Websockets

## Modularity:
- Config files
- Schema
- Default communication adapters (Websocket, HTTP)
- Access Control Lists
- Built-In and Custom indexing algorithms (linked lists, time based, geospatial, History, etc)
- Storage (IndexDB, localStorage, Radix, Bring your own)
